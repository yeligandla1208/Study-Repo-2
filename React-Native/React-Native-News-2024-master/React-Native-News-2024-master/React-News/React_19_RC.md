# RSC (React Server Component) now in React 19 üíØ

$\textcolor{chocolate}{\text{\textbf{Posted on May 30, 2024}}}$

Hey **React Native ü©µ** Developers,

The biggest **React** Conference, [**React Conf 2024**](https://conf.react.dev/) organized by [**Meta**](https://x.com/Meta) and [**Callstack**](https://x.com/callstackio), wrapped up recently. It was a two-day event that started on May 15th, filled with exciting talks. One of the most exciting talks was on **‚ùù RSC now in React 19 ‚ùû**. Today, we will explore more details about it! üöÄ

$\textcolor{crimson}{\text{\textbf{NOTE:}}}$ If you want to learn more about all the exciting talks at [**React Conf 2024**](https://conf.react.dev/), then read my detailed [**article (news)**](https://github.com/anisurrahman072/React-Native-News-2024/blob/master/React-Native-Conference-Talks/React-Conf-2024.md) on it.

# Back to Stage üòÉ

So, the **React** team announced **React 19** as **RC (Release Candidate)** which means React 19 will be stable in the next few weeks. Also, **React 19 RC** is now available on npm as **V18.3**. One of the most exciting parts of React 19 is that **RSC (React Server Component)** is now stable and will not break between major versions. Let‚Äôs explore RSC in-depth. üöÄ

# What is RSC?

**RSC (React Server Component)** is a rendering technique where the Server can send fully interactive, dynamic UI components (Ex: custom sliders) to the client (web, desktop, or Mobile device).

RSC allows developers to write components that render on both the **server** and the **client**. It also allows for selective rendering of components on the server, which means only the necessary components are rendered, reducing the server‚Äôs computational load. In RSC, initial rendering happens on the server, improving performance and reducing user wait time.

In the next section, we will learn more details about how RSC works from [Evan Bacon](https://x.com/Baconbrix)'s talk.

$\textcolor{crimson}{\text{\textbf{NOTE:}}}$ 2 more rendering techniques in React World came before the birth of **RSC**.

- Client Side Rendering (CSR)
- Server Side Rendering (SSR)

# Client Side Rendering (CSR)

In this rendering technique, the final HTML content and user interface (UI) components are generated on the client's browser or Mobile app using JavaScript.

Client-side rendering can cause slow performance and SEO issues, so SSR (Server Side Rendering) came to improve loading times and page visibility for search engines.

# Server Side Rendering (SSR)

This rendering technique is used in web development where the web page's content is rendered on the server instead of the client's browser & then sent to the device as JSON (a static UI representation) which makes the UX (user experience) faster page transitions & better SEO.

Pretty cool **SSR**, right? But wait, did you notice that in the line above, we mentioned **SSR uses JSON** (basically HTML)? Yes, that **JSON** is not interactive. So, to create a dynamic and interactive UI, RSC came into the spotlight üíØ.

Pretty cool! Now let's see how **RSC (React Server Component)** can be in real life by using [**Expo Router**](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) üöÄ

# React Server Components in Expo Router üôå

So, another most exciting news from **React Conf 2024** is that [**Evan Bacon**](https://x.com/Baconbrix) from the [**Expo**](https://x.com/expo) team has introduced **RSC** across all platforms (web, desktop, mobile) via the **Expo Router**.

To learn more about this talk, let‚Äôs first understand what the **Expo Router** is.

# The Expo Router

Expo Router is the first file-based routing system to build react apps that run on both web & native platforms.

With the help of **Expo Router**, the RSC server can handle multi-platform requests. When a request is made from an iOS or Android device, or even from a web browser, the server recognizes the platform and renders the appropriate version of the server components.

# Server-driven UI: RSC

There are some mobile apps (e.g., Lyft, Netflix, Reddit) that implement a server-driven UI in their native applications, which can be quite complex to configure. They are using some common architecture such as JSON (a static UI representation by HTML for a custom native application). However, this JSON does not facilitate **user interaction** with the UI.

Here, **RSC** (React Server Components)¬†has¬†advanced this concept by directly sending JSX components from the server to the client (web, desktop, or mobile device) to handle user interactions.

# RSC with Expo Router

The main goal of Expo Router is to make this server-driven UI interactive for developers. Below, we see three mobile applications that were showcased at the conference.

1. **ChatGPT 4 App:** It utilizes a server-driven UI with JSON. Since JSON is a static UI representation, it does not allow users to interact with the UI (e.g., clicking a button to reveal more data about an image).
2. **Gemini AI App:** It is the same as the ChatGPT 4 application.
3. **Expo Router AI App:** It also uses Server-driven UI but with an RSC data pattern (where server sends directly JSX code to the client device). This enables users to interact with the UI seamlessly. For instance, Evan Bacon demonstrated this by performing a long press on an image, which then opened a menu. Moreover, the RSC data pattern allows for the integration of native access, such as scheduling a date in the calendar, with the rendered JSX component.

In the Expo Router AI app, we observed Evan Bacon demonstrating a Map view (below). This Map view is a client component because it relies on the Native API. However, all the data for this Map was fetched on the server, and the carousel at the bottom, which we also received, was rendered using a React Server Component.

**`NOTE:`** The RSC server sends only JavaScript code to the client. It does not transmit any native bindings or native code (for example, Calendar API, Map API, etc.) to the client‚Äôs device.

Now, let‚Äôs learn a bit about the data pattern that RSC uses.

# RSC data pattern

When a **client** (web or mobile device) requests the Server then an **`RSC payload`** (static representation of the JSX code) is sent back with suspense (**loading components**) to keep the stream open.

![alt text](../images/ReactConf2024/image-2.png)

These are the key points that an **RSC payload** carries and executes during the stream‚Äôs progress:

1. It carries the root **`JSX code`** in a static representation (JSON) format.
2. It then carries a **`URL`** that contains only the **client code** **(Client JS bundle),** which is necessary for RSC to load (hydrate) to be interactive for handling user actions.
3. Subsequently, it carries the currently rendered **`UI element`** (Ex: Text element). React‚Äôs Suspense feature is used here to ensure that the server can keep sending updates to the client (Ex: At first server sent **‚ÄúOnce‚Äù** and then sent **‚ÄúOnce upon a time‚Äù**). As more data is sent from the server to the client, the page or screen can keep updating with new content by updating the react tree. This continuous update process enables the client application to respond instantly to user interactions, resulting in a seamless experience.
4. Finally, once the stream is complete, React will terminate the connection.

Below is the final data pattern illustrating how the **RSC server** transmits data to the client (web, desktop, or mobile), as presented by **Evan Bacon** on stage.
