# React Native for Apple Vision Pro 👨‍🚀

$\textcolor{chocolate}{\text{\textbf{Posted on May 30, 2024}}}$

Hey **React Native 🩵** Developers,

The biggest **React** Conference, [**React Conf 2024**](https://conf.react.dev/) organized by [**Meta**](https://x.com/Meta) and [**Callstack**](https://x.com/callstackio), wrapped up recently. It was a two-day event that started on May 15th, filled with exciting talks. One of the most exciting talks was on **❝ React Native for Apple Vision Pro ❞**. Today, we will explore more details about it! 🚀

$\textcolor{crimson}{\text{\textbf{NOTE:}}}$ If you want to learn more about all the exciting talks at [**React Conf 2024**](https://conf.react.dev/), then read my detailed [**article (news)**](https://github.com/anisurrahman072/React-Native-News-2024/blob/master/React-Native-Conference-Talks/React-Conf-2024.md) on it.

# Back to Stage 💁‍♂️

So, [**Michal**](https://x.com/thymikee) from [**Callstack**](https://x.com/callstackio) has introduced the React world to the [**`react-native-visionos`**](https://github.com/callstack/react-native-visionos) SDK for Apple Vision Pro. It’s a great contribution from [Oskar](https://x.com/o_kwasniewski), who has conducted very thorough research on it over the past few months 💯.

# React Native VisionOS

React Native visionOS is an out-of-tree platform that forks from the React Native core, extending its possibilities to new platforms. Examples of such projects include [React Native Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows), [React Native macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos), and [React Native tvOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos).

# Start with Apple Vision Pro using React Native

You don’t need an Apple Vision Pro to make apps; using a simulator is enough. To create a new project you can use the React Native Community CLI:

```bash
npx @callstack/react-native-visionos@latest init NotJustDevVisionApp
```

# Live Demo

[**Michal**](https://x.com/thymikee) presented a live demo in which he loaded a 3D element with an impressive space background, powered by JavaScript, React Native Gesture Handler, and React Native Reanimated. 🚀
